## 💼 Workforce Health & Compensation Dashboard
This interactive analytical dashboard provides an overview of employee statistics, including total staff, salary costs, sick days, and balance days, along with breakdowns by job type, gender, marital status, education, role, and promotions. It also visualizes sick days and balance days across departments and business units for better. It also explores workforce health indicators and compensation metrics across various business units, job roles, education levels, and demographic categories in major U.S. cities.

## 📌 Short Description / Purpose
This dashboard provides HR analysts and business decision-makers with a dynamic view into employee wellness (measured through sick days and balance days), salary cost distribution, job classification trends, and demographic patterns across major city offices like New York City, Seattle, Houston, and Los Angeles. It helps optimize workforce planning, compensation strategy, and well-being initiatives across organizations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Core platform for building visualizations and interactivity.

📂 Power Query – Used for data shaping, cleaning, and transformations.

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For custom calculated measures such as average salary, total sick days, and dynamic filtering.

📁 File Format – .pbix for interactive dashboard design and .png for image sharing.

## 🗂️ Data Source
The data used in this dashboard was sourced from cleaned and structured Excel files derived from Microsoft’s Adventure Works human resources dataset. These files included comprehensive employee records such as salary information, sick and balance days, job types, educational backgrounds, and demographic attributes across various business units and cities. The Excel files were loaded into Power BI for further modeling and visualization.

## 🔍 Features / Highlights
• Business Problem
HR departments often lack a holistic view of how employee well-being and compensation vary by role, education, and location. This makes it difficult to tailor employee engagement strategies or identify workforce inefficiencies.

• Goal of the Dashboard
To create a data-driven visual tool that:

Monitors total and average sick/balance days per employee group.

Compares salary costs across cities, job roles, and education levels.

Analyzes workforce distribution based on involvement, satisfaction, and classification.

Supports HR in strategic decisions for budgeting, workforce health, and equity.
